# OptinMonster 60% Off: Turn Leaving Visitors into Subscribers, Recover Lost Sales, Grow Your List Fast

---

You know that feeling when someone walks into your store, browses around for ten minutes, and then just… leaves? No purchase. No sign-up. Nothing. They're gone, and you have zero idea why.

That happens on websites about 70% of the time. Seventy percent of your visitors just bounce, and most of them never come back. For a long time, there wasn't much you could do about it. You'd just watch the analytics, shrug, and wonder where the money went.

Then OptinMonster showed up, and the whole game changed.

I've been poking around this tool for a while now, tested it across a few different sites, and talked to people who've been using it for years. Here's the honest rundown — what it actually does, what it costs, and whether it's worth the money.

## So What Does OptinMonster Actually Do?

The short version: it catches people right before they leave your site and gives them a reason to stay — or at least to hand over their email.

The longer version is more interesting. OptinMonster lets you build all kinds of lead capture campaigns — popups, floating bars, slide-in scroll boxes, fullscreen overlays, inline forms, sidebar forms, and even gamified coupon wheels. You pick a template from their library of 700+, drag and drop your way to something that looks good, and set it live. No coding required. Seriously, none.

But the real magic isn't in the popups themselves. It's in *when* and *where* those popups show up. OptinMonster has a pretty sophisticated targeting engine that lets you control exactly who sees what, and when.

## The Feature Everyone Talks About: Exit Intent® Technology

If you've heard of OptinMonster at all, you've probably heard about Exit Intent®. It's their flagship feature, and honestly, it's the reason most people sign up.

Here's how it works on desktop: OptinMonster tracks where your visitor's mouse cursor is moving. The second that cursor starts drifting toward the top of the browser — toward the address bar or the close button — the tool knows the person is about to leave. At that exact moment, a targeted popup fires. On mobile, it works differently. It detects when someone starts scrolling back up the page quickly, which is a pretty reliable signal that they're about to tap away.

The results people report are genuinely wild. One company added over 95,000 email subscribers in seven months using just Exit Intent. Another doubled their subscription rate overnight. A marketing firm reported their client's conversion rate jumping from 2% to over 10% after adding OptinMonster's exit-intent campaigns. Scott Wyden Imagery recovered 21% of abandoned carts this way.

Exit Intent® is only available on the **Pro plan and above**, which is worth keeping in mind when you're choosing a plan.

## What Else Is Going On Under the Hood?

Beyond Exit Intent, there's a lot happening inside OptinMonster that makes it genuinely useful day-to-day:

**OnSite Retargeting®** — This one's clever. Instead of only targeting people who are *new* to your site, OptinMonster studies what returning visitors have already done. Did they read a blog post? Click on a product? Spend three minutes on a page? OptinMonster uses that data to show them something different and relevant the next time they visit. One company, Podcast Insights, reported a 1,099% increase in conversions using this feature.

**Smart Tags™** — These let you personalize your campaigns dynamically. You can pull in a visitor's first name, location, or other details and drop them right into your popup copy. Instead of "Hey there!" your visitor sees "Hey Sarah!" It sounds small, but personalization like this consistently lifts conversion rates.

**A/B Testing** — You can run split tests on your campaigns to figure out which headline, design, or offer actually converts better. This is available starting on the Plus plan.

**Countdown Timers** — Want to create urgency? Add a ticking clock to your offer. Works especially well for limited-time promotions or free trial signups.

**Behavior Automation** — You can trigger campaigns based on specific visitor actions: how long they've been on a page, how far they've scrolled, whether they're inactive, and more. It's like having a smart assistant watching your visitors and knowing exactly when to step in.

**AI-Powered Copy Suggestions** — A newer addition. OptinMonster now includes "Smart Optimizations" that use AI to suggest improved copy for your campaigns. You click a button, it generates alternatives, and you pick the one that fits best.

## Who Actually Uses This Thing?

OptinMonster is used by over 1 million websites across more than 120 countries. The user base is pretty broad — bloggers, eCommerce stores, SaaS companies, marketing agencies, nonprofits, and pretty much anyone with a website and a reason to capture leads.

Real people, real results:

- **Cole Joseph** (Smart Marketer) reported increasing sales by $55,000 after capturing nearly 7% more leads with a single OptinMonster optin.
- **Michael Stelzner** (Social Media Examiner) added 95,654 names to his email list in seven months.
- **Neil Patel** (QuickSprout) said exit-intent popups doubled his opt-in rate and delivered an instant 12% lift in sales.
- **Lilach Bullock** reported adding up to 1,000 new subscribers per month — with zero paid promotions.
- One marketing agency saw a client go from a 2% conversion rate to over 10% after implementing OptinMonster across their site.

On the review side, OptinMonster holds a 4.2/5 rating on Capterra based on 78 verified reviews. Users consistently praise the drag-and-drop builder, the targeting options, and the support team. Common complaints include a learning curve with advanced features and the fact that you need a separate email marketing service to actually send the emails OptinMonster helps you collect.

## Integrations: Does It Play Nice With Everything Else?

One of OptinMonster's strengths is how broadly it integrates. It connects natively with most of the big names in email marketing and CRM:

Mailchimp, Constant Contact, AWeber, GetResponse, ActiveCampaign, Klaviyo, HubSpot, ConvertKit, Drip, MailerLite, Salesforce, Marketo, Campaign Monitor, Brevo, and dozens more.

On top of that, you get Zapier integration (Pro plan and up), webhooks, and a public API for anything custom. If your specific tool isn't natively supported, there's a good chance you can connect it through one of those options.

It also works with pretty much any website platform — WordPress (with a dedicated plugin), Shopify, WooCommerce, Squarespace, Wix, and more. The only real requirement is that your site allows you to add custom JavaScript.

## Which Plan Should You Actually Get?

Here's the honest take:

**If you're just starting out** and your site gets modest traffic, the **Basic plan at $7/mo** is a fine way to dip your toes in. You get all the campaign types, the template library, and basic targeting. It works for one site with 2,500 campaign impressions per month.

**If you want to actually test and optimize**, the **Plus plan at $19/mo** is where things start getting interesting. A/B testing alone is worth the step up, especially if you're running multiple campaigns.

**If you want the best bang for your buck**, most users — and most reviewers — point to the **Pro plan at $29/mo**. This is where you unlock Exit Intent® Technology, which is the single most talked-about feature on the platform. You also get countdown timers, Smart Tags, campaign scheduling, and integrations with Zapier and Google Analytics. For eCommerce stores or any site where cart abandonment is a real problem, this is the sweet spot.

**If you're running an agency or a serious eCommerce operation**, the **Growth plan at $49/mo** gives you everything, including OnSite Retargeting®, geolocation targeting, Shopify and WooCommerce integrations, and unlimited sub-accounts for managing client sites.

## A Few Things Worth Knowing Before You Sign Up

OptinMonster is not perfect. Here's what people actually complain about:

**You need a separate email service.** OptinMonster captures leads, but it doesn't send emails. You'll need Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or something similar to actually do anything with those subscribers. This catches some new users off guard.

**The advanced features have a learning curve.** Setting up OnSite Retargeting or behavior-based automation isn't exactly one-click. If you want to fully unlock what the tool can do, expect to spend some time in their documentation or University courses.

**Pricing adds up if you need the top features.** Exit Intent® and OnSite Retargeting® are locked behind the Pro and Growth plans respectively. If you signed up for Basic thinking you'd get everything, you'll eventually want to upgrade.

**Auto-renewal is on by default.** Annual plans renew automatically at full price. You can turn this off, but it's worth being aware of upfront.

On the flip side — the things people consistently love: the drag-and-drop builder is genuinely easy to use, the support team gets praised over and over again in reviews, and the targeting engine is more sophisticated than most competitors offer at this price range.
